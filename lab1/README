This is the Introduction Lab.
It contains:
  1. Writing hello-world program in C++.
  2. Creating a program that asks for the radius of a circle and prints the area of that circle.
  3. Writing a program that reads in a positive integer and outputs "ODD" if the integer is odd and "EVEN" if the integer is even.
  4. Modifying the previous program so that it keeps reading positive integers and classifying them as ODD or EVEN until the user inputs -1.
  5. Creating a program that takes in the sentence to be written out, and the number of times it needs to be repeated, and produce the desired output.
  6. Creating a program that opens a file named words.txt and counts the whitespace-separated words in that file.
  7. Creating a program that reads in a word from the user and counts the number of occurrences of that word in a file called words.txt.
  8. Writing a simple run-length encoder.
  9. Writing a program that prints out the prime numbers.
10. Wrting a program that reads strings of different sizes.
